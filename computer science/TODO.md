    Permutations
    Subsets
    BFS Graph
    DFS Graph
    Dijkstra’s Algorithm (just learn the idea — no need to implement)
    Tree Traversals — BFS, DFS (in-order, pre-order, post-order): Implement Recursive and Iterative
    External Sort — No implementation; Just know the concept.
    NP-Complete (Video) — Just know the concept
    Topological Sort
    Detect cycle in an undirected graph
    Detect a cycle in a directed graph
